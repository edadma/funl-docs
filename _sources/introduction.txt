Introduction
============

*FunL* (pronounced "funnel") is a functional dynamically typed scripting language. The name FunL stands for "fun language", but it can also stand for "functional language".  One of the goals in creating FunL was to make a scripting language that would be as enjoyable and convenient to use as Python but with the added support for pattern matching and more of a "functional" style of programming.  FunL has the same kind of indentation or "off-side rule" syntax as Python.

As an example, here is a tail-recursive version of the well known factorial function::

    def factorial( n )
      | n >= 0 =
        def
          fact( acc, 0 ) = acc
          fact( acc, n ) = fact( acc*n, n - 1 )

        fact( 1, n )
      | otherwise = error( "factorial: n should be non-negative" )

Here is the same calculation expressed more concisely (which is also tail-recursive internally)::

    def factorial( n ) = product( 1..n )

Another goal in creating FunL was to have a scripting language that is highly Java and Scala interoperable.  FunL is implemented in Scala and therefore relies upon both the Scala and Java runtime support libraries.


Installing
----------

If you haven't yet done so, please download the software from https://dl.bintray.com/edadma/generic/funl-dev.jar.  If you are on Windows, then it's probably best to just download it to your Desktop.  Their is no special installation procedure for the software itself, other than the fact that it runs on a platform known as the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), which you can get for free at http://java.com.  Just click on *Free Java Download* and follow their installation instructions.  Once the JVM is installed, you will be able to run the FunL REPL (repeat evaluate print loop) by starting a command line window (however you do that in the operating system you are using), changing to the directory where you downloaded the program, and typing::

	java -jar funl-0.17.jar

After executing the above command to run the REPL, you shoud see::

	    ______            __
	   / ____/_  __ ___  / /     FunL Programming Language

	Welcome to FunL version 0.17
	Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
	Type :help for more information.

	FunL>

If so, you can now enter FunL expressions at the prompt.

Program files are executed by the following command::

	java -jar <path to funl.jar> <program filename>

The program filename can be entered without the ``.funl`` filename extension.  If the filename does not end with ``.funl``, it is assumed.


Getting Started
---------------

The FunL REPL allows expressions to be evaluated, but in the current version, no function declarations can be made.  Variable assignments are possible, however.  For example, if you enter::

	1/2 + 2/3

at the prompt, you should see::

	res1: ca.hyperreal.lia.Rational = 7/6

The example highlights FunL's *exact arithmetic* capability.  The type ``ca.hyperreal.lia.Rational`` is the rational or fraction type. The REPL creates a new variable for every result.  In this case, the result variable is ``res1``.  The following code::

	res1^-1

should produce the expected result of inverting the fraction to yield :math:`\frac6 7`.

FunL also uses JSON syntax for the *map* type.  The following code (with each line entered separately)::

	a = {"one": 1, "two": 2}

	a.two

should produce the expected result of ``2``.  Also, the *dot notation* can be used to access object members, as in JavaScript.


Running Scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We will now look at running small scripts.  Two examples will be given in this sub-section.  The next major section presents a complete language tutorial.  The first example script is the obligatory "hello world" program in FunL.  Create a text file called ``hello.funl`` with the following contents::

	println( 'Hello World' )

Now, open a command window (shell) and change to the directory that contains ``hello.funl`` and type the command::

	java -jar <path to funl.jar> hello

You should see ``Hello World`` being output.  ``println`` means "print a line" and causes the given expression to be output, followed by a new-line character.

As a more interesting example, here is an (not fairly efficient) implementation of the Quick Sort.  Create a file called ``quicksort.funl`` with the following contents::

	def
	  qsort( [] )   = []
	  qsort( p:xs ) = qsort( xs.filter((< p)) ) + [p] + qsort( xs.filter((>= p)) )

	println( qsort([4, 2, 1, 3, 0, 2]) )
	println( qsort(["Bob", "Alice", "Barry", "Zoe", "Charlotte", "Fred"]) )

Run the program by typing::

	java -jar <path to funl.jar> quicksort

at the command prompt.  You should see::

	[0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4]
	[Alice, Barry, Bob, Charlotte, Fred, Zoe]
